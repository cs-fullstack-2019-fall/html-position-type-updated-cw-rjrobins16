<div>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup
    language like HTML.[1]
    CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.[2]

    <div>CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural content.

        Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.[4] </div>

    <div>In CSS, selectors declare which part of the markup a style applies to by matching tags and attributes in the markup itself.

        Selectors may apply to the following:

        all elements of a specific type, e.g. the second-level headers h2
        elements specified by attribute, in particular:
        id: an identifier unique within the document
        class: an identifier that can annotate multiple elements in a document
        elements depending on how they are placed relative to others in the document tree.
        Classes and IDs are case-sensitive, start with letters, and can include alphanumeric characters, hyphens and underscores. A class may apply to any number of instances of any elements. An ID may only be applied to a single element.</div>
    <article> <span class="sectiontitles">< article > </span>
    <div> A declaration block consists of a list of declarations in braces. Each declaration itself consists of a property, a colon (:), and a value. If there are multiple declarations in a block, a semi-colon (;) must be inserted to separate each declaration.[9]

<footer> <span class="sectiontitles"> < footer > </span> <div> Problems with patchy adoption of CSS, along with errata in the original specification, led the W3C to revise the CSS 2 standard into CSS 2.1, which moved nearer to a working snapshot of current CSS support in HTML browsers. Some CSS 2 properties that no browser successfully implemented were dropped, and in a few cases, defined behaviors were changed to bring the standard into line with the predominant existing implementations. </div> </footer>
